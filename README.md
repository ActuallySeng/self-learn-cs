**ACHIEVEMENTS**
1. Wrote my first ~500 lines of code.
- Space invader final project for Systematic Program Design (Week 6A)

2. Coded for ~12 hours straight.
- Systematic Program Design - NQueens (Week 9B)
- Hardest question I have come across, especially the template blending between arbitrary-arity trees and generative recursion.
- Very proud of myself when I have completed it. Never give up!

3. Project lasted 3 days.
- Class-based Program Design Assignment 5: 10 Bullets
- I didnt know how to apply generics in code so this project was one that made my confidence wane. But I never gave up and kept going for 3 days until it got solved. :)
